# Service Provider Migration

When companies merge or are acquired, they consolide suppliers to gain economies of scale. However, migrating data from an acquired company's UCaaS / CCaaS onto the acquiring company’s platform can be problematic.&#x20;

Often the acquired company’s customer data and historical conversations are lost, or an expensive data migration project is undertaken. Businesses discover their customer conversation data is not really their data.

With vCon such a migration becomes an export / import of the historical conversations.&#x20;

This could also be applied to a personal use case where an individual wants to download all their communications from a social network.\
