### Simplifying Working with Bots

Many programmable communication developers share the same experiences when they begin working on voice bots and transcriptions. They begin by capturing the conversation data with MS Word or Excel files. Often a combination of both to better represent conversations and enable the transcriptions to be processed / cleaned-up.

Later they build a JSON format that includes conversation data, transcriptions, context, etc. Soon they begin writing macros / functions to automate conversation data processing and analysis. With that comes maintaining both the JSON format and the macros / functions, and a realization they do not have the time to build everything themselves. vCon solves this common problem and enables macros / functions to be written to this common format and contributed to the open source project.
