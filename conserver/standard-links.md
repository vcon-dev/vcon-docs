# ðŸ”— Standard Links

The conserver ships with a standard set of links.
Custom links can be installed by adding them into the "links" subdirectory.
The link represents an operation on a vCon, such as redaction, sharing and analysis.
The conserver can have many different configurations of the same kind of link, making them the essential unit of functionality.

Currently, the standard sets of links are:

* **Analyze**:  Calls OpenAI to process a vCon with a LLM prompt, and adding a new item to the analysis array.
* **Deepgram**:  Calls Deepgram to transcribe the dialog and add an new "transcription" item to the analysis array.
* **Expire vCon**:  Sets the expiration time for the vCon in REDIS.
* **Post analysis to Slack**:  Posts a specified analysis item to REDIS. &#x20;
* **SCITT**: Updates the SCITT ledger
* **Tag**: Adds a tag to the "attachments" array
* **Transcribe**: Calls Whisper to transcribe the dialog and add an new "transcription" item to the analysis array.
* **Webhook**: Posts vCon to URL
